            <h2>Consumer Purchase Terms and Conditions</h2>

            <h3>E-NIC Ebike Store </h3>
            <h4>Last updated Dec 10, 2021</h4>
                        
            <p>These Consumer Purchase Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) are a legal agreement between you and E-NIC Ebike Store Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“E-NIC”, “us” or “we”), and apply to all consumer purchases by you of any model of E-NIC’s electric bikes (“ebike(s)”) and/or related accessories or other products offered by E-NIC (collectively with ebikes, the “Products”) in Canada. By purchasing any Products from E-NIC, whether online or at our showroom, you thereby agree to these Terms in their entirety. Please read these Terms carefully as they list your obligations and rights and include a requirement that all disputes that you may have under these Terms be taken to arbitration, instead of a jury trial or class action.</p>
            
            <h4>1. Application</h4>
            <p>These Terms apply to your purchase of the Products and use of the ebikes. Other interactions that you have with E-NIC are subject to other agreements, including the:</p>
                   <ul>
                   <li>Limited Warranty Terms</li>
                   <li>Terms of Use</li>
                   <li>Privacy Notice</li>
                   <li>Owner’s Manual</li>
            <p>A copy of these Terms and all other documents which apply to your purchase of Products are available for you to read on our website.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Ebike Online or In-Store Orders</h4>
            <p>In the event you are purchasing an ebike (i) by ordering online, (ii) in a E-NIC retail store (as opposed to a direct purchase in store of in-stock item), E-NIC will send you an email confirming our receipt of your order. E-NIC has accepted your order upon shipment of the ebike. We reserve the right at any time, even after we send you a confirmation email, to decline or cancel your order or to limit order quantities for any reason, including errors or suspected fraud.</p>
            <h4>3. Shipping</h4>
            <p>All orders under $150 qualify for a flat rate of $10 shipping charge. Select orders of $150 or more may qualify for free shipping. Products excluded from the flat rate shipping and free shipping offer are: Batteries ($60 shipping charge per item). Palletized freight orders are subject to additional fees.
            We are currently only shipping to Canada (except to the Yukon Territory, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut).
                1. A shipping confirmation email will be sent to the email address attached to the order once the order has shipped.
                2. We will use FedEx or other parcel service to ship your order. We DO NOT ship to PO Boxes or APO.
                3. Orders containing discounted merchandise may take an additional 48 hours to process.
                   
                4. Any changes that you make regarding shipping once the item is shipped, including but not limited to changing the address, putting an order on hold, or updating shipping settings/preferences may delay your receipt of the Product and replacement Productand/or refunds. If you would like to change the color or size of your ebike, you must do so prior to your order being shipped.
                5. Please note we are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged items due to the actions or inactions of FedEx or any other parcel service.
                6. You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. We recommend using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance. We cannot guarantee that we will receive the item you are attempting to return. For more information regarding our limited warranty and claims process, please review our Limited Warranty Terms, which are incorporated in to by reference and form a part of these Terms.
                7. For any third-party shipping outside of E-NIC’s normal shipping process, E-NIC will not provide ANY additional shipping information or documentation.
                8. Orders placed through our online store (www.e-nic.ca) with the shipping address of an E-NIC retail location will be cancelled. To purchase Products in store please locate an E-NIC retail showroom near you.</p>
            <h4>6. Ownership</h4>
                   <p>1.Title to all Products ordered by you and risk of loss to such Products will transfer to you at the time E-NIC delivers such Products to the applicable shipping carrier.
                   2.Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we have not received payment in full for the Products prior to their delivery, then the products will remain our property until such time as payment is received in full. We reserve the right (subject to applicable law) to terminate your right to use the Products if payment is not made when due, or if the credit/debit card company declines payment or requires us to return any payment made for the Products, for any reason.</p>
            <h4>7. Returns Policy</h4>
            <p>In order to undertake a valid return, you must obtain written approval for such return from E-NIC. Any Products sent back to E-NIC by you without the written consent of E-NIC shall be rejected and returned to you at your cost.
                1. Purchased Products that have not yet shipped may be cancelled for a full refund.</p>
            
            <h4>8. Ebike Returns</h4>
            <p>Free returns within fourteen (14) days of delivery. To return an ebike that is not defective or damaged, you must contact E-NIC within fourteen (14) days of your receipt of the ebike. The ebike must have less than ten (10) kilometers on the odometer, be free of any wear and tear, dirt, dust, fragrance, or any other signs of use and must be in the same packaging and condition that you receive it and must include all items that were inside the box (charger, keys, hardware, etc.). You must receive prior authorization and a prepaid return shipping label from E-NIC. Any warranty issues must be resolved prior to processing a return. Returns are not allowed after fourteen (14) days of the delivery date.
                1. Pre-Orders and Backorders and Pre-Order/Backorder Cancellations. Our backorder process is for ebikes that have already been available but are temporarily out of stock. For all pre-orders and backorders, your credit/debit card will be charged immediately. There will be no delay in payment collection, regardless of when the item is expected to ship.
                2. Accessory and Replacement Parts. Any purchase of accessories or receipt of a replacement part under the Limited Warranty shall be eligible for return within thirty (30) days of receipt. Any returned accessory or replacement part must be unused, free of any wear and tear, dirt, dust, fragrance, or any other signs of use and must be sealed and unopened in the same packaging and condition in which you received it. You will be responsible for paying for shipping both ways and will be subject to a twenty-five percent (25%) restocking fee.
                3. Non-returnable/non-refundable Items. Used Products, batteries, special orders, sale items, gift cards and gifted orders shall not be returnable except in EXTREME cases of breakage/malfunction covered by our warranty, and then only after receipt of our approval for the return. “Built and Delivered” fees are nonrefundable.
                4. Refunds. Any item returned with an order that used a discount code will have the entire discount code value subtracted from the refund value, whether you return one ebike or multiple ebikes.
            
            Refunds will be made after the Ebike is received and inspected.
                5. Process. Please ship all approved returns using the shipping label provided during the return merchandise authorization process.</p>
            
            <h4>9. Ebike Performance</h4>
            <p>Please note that information regarding the expected range on a single charge on one of our ebikes is an estimate, not a guarantee. There are many factors that contribute to actual, real-world range for an ebike battery such as age of the battery, temperature, level of assist, speed, payload, and terrain. Given the right conditions, it is possible to get less than the expected minimum range or greater than the expected maximum range. E-NIC reserves the right to use substitute parts, material, or equipment of equivalent quality and value that meet E-NIC’s strict standards).
                    1. Street Legality. All of our ebikes as manufactured are street legal in accordance with the federal laws of Canada. It is your responsibility to be aware of specific local restrictions on the use or operation of the ebike in your community, which may be more restrictive than the federal laws of Canada.
                    2. Alteration. Any alterations, modifications, or other changes made by you to an ebike following your purchase which affect the safety, operation, or mechanics of the ebike shall void the Warranty and shall be at your sole risk of harm.</p>
            
            <h4>10. Payments</h4>
            <p>Our website is powered by Shopify and all payments made by you to E-NIC are processed through Shopify’s payment portal. Payments may be declined or returned to you, in E-NIC’s sole discretion, for any reason or no reason at all. If we accept a pre-order of any Product, your account, credit card, or other payment mechanism will be charged upon approval by E-NIC, regardless of when your purchase is expected to ship. If any credit card chargeback of any amount is issued on an order, the Limited Warranty for that order will be paused until the chargeback has been resolved.
                1. Tax. All applicable taxes (including sales tax) will be collected on all orders where such taxes are required to be collected.</p>

            <p>WE ARE ONLY LIABLE TO YOU FOR LOSSES WHICH YOU SUFFER AS A DIRECT RESULT OF OUR BREACH OF THESE TERMS AND WHICH ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. OUR LIABILITY FOR SUCH LOSSES SHALL BE NO MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF PURCHASE OF OUR PRODUCTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH LOSSES. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER LOSSES.

You agree to release, waive, defend, indemnify, and hold E-NIC and its directors, officers, employees, agents, members, partners, suppliers, and licensors harmless and will keep them indemnified from any third-party claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, relating to or arising from: (a) your purchase or use of any Products; (b) any violation by you of these Terms; or (c) your violation of another party’s rights or applicable law.

            <h4>15. Governing Law</h4>
            <h5>THIS GOVERNING LAW CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY TO QUEBEC CONSUMERS</h5>

            <h4>16. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration</h4>
            <h5>THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY TO QUEBEC CONSUMERS</h5>
            <p>Where permitted by applicable law, all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or in connection with or in relation to these Terms or the breach thereof, including any and all disputes, claims or question regarding: (a) the existence, validity, application, interpretation, performance, enforcement or termination of these Terms; (b) any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the negotiation, execution, interpretation, application or performance of these Terms; or (c) any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the design, manufacture, distribution, instruction, warning, performance or use of a Product, will be solely and exclusively referred to, and finally resolved by, binding arbitration pursuant to the Domestic Commercial Arbitration Rules of Procedures (if you are a Canadian customer) or the International Commercial Arbitration Rules of Procedure (if you are a customer located outside of Canada) of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre then in force (respectively, the “Arbitration Rules”). A single arbitrator will be appointed by agreement of the parties, or, if in default of agreement, such arbitrator will be appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia and will be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to award costs of the arbitration, including attorney’s’ fees and disbursements and arbitrator fees and expenses. Any award and the determination of such arbitrator will be final and binding upon you and E-NIC.

            <h4>17. Notice and Updates</h4>
            <p>E-NIC will provide all notices (including legal process) that E-NIC is required to give by any lawful method, including by making notice available through the Site or by sending it to any e-mail or mailing address that you provide to E-NIC.

            <h4>18. General</h4>
            <p>Section titles are only for convenience and have no legal or contractual significance. Any list of examples following “including” or “e.g.,” is illustrative and not exhaustive, unless qualified by terms like “only” or “solely.” E-NIC’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its rights to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. A waiver will only be binding on E-NIC if it is in a written document signed by E-NIC. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining terms, covenants and restrictions will remain in full force and effect. You and E-NIC intend that the provisions of these Terms be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Accordingly, you and E-NIC agree that if any provision is deemed unenforceable, where possible, it will be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, which may include its deletion. E-NIC may assign its rights and delegate its obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you, and these Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of E-NIC’s successors and assigns. E-NIC shall have the right to assign these Terms, at its sole discretion, without notice to you. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense your rights (if any). These Terms (including any incorporated terms) and any Additional Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and E-NIC with respect to the Site. Both you and E-NIC warrant to each other that, in entering this agreement, neither E-NIC nor you have relied on nor will have any right or remedy based upon any statement, representation, warranty, or assurance other than those expressly stated in these Terms (including any incorporated terms) and any Additional Terms. The preceding sentence will not limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law. No one other than you and E-NIC, or E-NIC’s successors and assigns, will have any right to enforce these Terms.</p>
            <h4>19. How To Contact E-NIC</h4>
            <p>If you have any questions or comments regarding these Terms, you may contact E-NIC by any of the methods available on our website at www.e-nic.ca or by mail at support@e-nic.ca .</p>
